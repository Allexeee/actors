ðŸš§ **IMPORTANT** ðŸš§   
The new version of Actors **is not compatible** with previous versions. If you are using ***Actors-2020-04-30***  or earlier version in the production cycle, please change your manifest link to: ```"com.pixeye.ecs": "https://github.com/PixeyeHQ/actors.unity.git#actors-2020-04-30",```

The framework was rewritten so there is no reason to write down all changes. Look [README](https://github.com/PixeyeHQ/actors.unity/blob/develop/README.md).
